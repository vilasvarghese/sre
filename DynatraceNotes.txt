Tools of Dynatrace

Below are the tools of Dynatrace:
1. Dynatrace

	managed in cloud in a SaaS platform. 
	Monitoring tool
		has all the logs 
		helps in monitoring 
			by checking all the history of logs in the system. 
	It troubleshoots 
		find  
			errors or byte code information 
	data is fetched and 
		shown in the 
			cloud platform or 
			the dashboard 
				so that any updates can be known easily and the errors are traced.

2. AIOps
	Artificial Intelligence for Operations 
		help user know the operations better and monitor data. 
	knows when to pitch in 
		during monitoring the data. 
	
	Techniques and algorithms used are purely in AI format. 
		like monitoring by humans 

3. Digital Experience Management
	know how the customer is being treated 
		by any application 
		how the customer feels about it. 
	Traditional method of survey
		not needed 
	DEM takes data from 
		site traffic


Applications of Dynatrace & Sensors

Below are the applications of Dynatrace and Sensors:

Dynatrace:
	Not only working of the application 
	performance details from scratch 
	The performance metrics offered in real-time
	problems are detected automatically 
	Diagnose the problems with proper solutions.
    
	
	Monitoring 
		done in the level of infrastructure and cloud. 
		Users need not worry about the applications when Dynatrace is used in the system. The applications’ working is autodetected, and all the transactions are monitored at any level to provide proper dependency in the system.
    AI is used for making the applications available always, and all the transactions are optimized so that any issues can be resolved using real-time data in the system. A single transaction is not left without a trace. With all the technologies in hand, greater productivity and efficiency is achieved in the system.
    As a user of the Dynatrace product, I could say that the tool’s security is priceless. External tools or applications will not work without the permission of Dynatrace, and they make sure the systems and their applications are protected from any external environment.

Sensors:

    Any applications with user-defined methods use method sensors in the application. These sensors are easy to trace and provide proper guidance to Dynatrace. It is important to know the sensor mechanism in the tool to know its working.
    Also, this helps in the memory of the application’s storage and logs. As sensors can sense any transactions being happening in the application, the logs are saved, and the tool is notified regarding the same.
    Auto sensors detect anything being done and also informs the tool automatically. This is a great help when the monitoring happens. Tracing of the applications and the external tools invading the system is known and stopped so that the security of the system is not compromised at all.
    Dynatrace has the capability to activate and deactivate the sensors based on their needs. This happens mainly with bytecode sensors as they are not needed always. The rules can be customized so that those sensors to be activated or deactivated can be understood easily. High priority sensors are listed at the top so that they are activated whenever in need.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dynatrace offers three different monitoring approaches: 
	OneAgent
	agentless monitoring
	synthetic monitoring. 
	
	Here's a brief overview of the differences between these approaches:

    OneAgent: 
		OneAgent is an agent-based approach to monitoring. 
		lightweight software agent that is installed on the host machine or container, and it collects data on application and infrastructure performance. OneAgent can monitor a wide range of metrics, including code-level performance, database queries, network performance, and more.

    Agentless monitoring: 
		Agentless monitoring is a non-intrusive approach to monitoring. It uses protocols like SNMP or JMX to remotely monitor infrastructure and application performance. This approach does not require installation of an agent and is ideal for monitoring devices that do not allow agent installation or have strict security policies.

    Synthetic monitoring: 
		Synthetic monitoring is a way to simulate user interactions with an application or service to monitor its performance. Synthetic monitoring is typically used to test the availability, functionality, and performance of web applications. Synthetic monitors are configured to mimic the behavior of real users and can be scheduled to run at regular intervals.




		Synthetic monitoring is a type of monitoring in Dynatrace that allows you to simulate user interactions with your web applications to test their performance and availability. With synthetic monitoring, you can create automated tests that mimic real user behavior, such as clicking on links, filling out forms, and navigating through different pages of the application.

		Here are some of the key features of synthetic monitoring in Dynatrace:

			Automated testing: 
				Synthetic monitors can be configured to run at regular intervals to test the availability, functionality, and performance of your web applications.
			Realistic user behavior: 
				Synthetic monitors are designed to mimic the behavior of real users, so you can get a realistic view of application performance.
			Multi-step transactions: 
				Synthetic monitors can be configured to perform multi-step transactions, such as logging in, adding items to a shopping cart, and checking out.
			Customizable test scenarios: 
				Synthetic monitors can be customized to test specific scenarios or user flows within your application.
			Detailed performance metrics: 
				Synthetic monitors provide detailed performance metrics, such as response time, error rate, and availability, so you can identify performance bottlenecks and resolve issues.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Dashboards

		Click on the "Create Dashboard" button in the upper-right corner.

		Give your dashboard a name and select the type of dashboard you want to create 
			(e.g. custom dashboard, application dashboard, etc.).

		Choose the metrics and data sources you want to include in your dashboard. 
			You can select from a range of pre-built dashboards and widgets or create your own custom widgets using the "Custom Chart" option.

		Customize the layout of your dashboard by adding, removing, or rearranging widgets as needed. You can also adjust the size and position of each widget to optimize the layout of your dashboard.

		Save your dashboard by clicking the "Save" button in the upper-right corner.

		Share your dashboard with other users or teams by clicking the "Share" button and selecting the users or groups you want to share it with.

			Finally, set up alerts and notifications for your dashboard by clicking the "Alerts" button and configuring the alerting rules and conditions as needed.

		Once you've created your dashboard, you can continue to customize and refine it over time to better suit your monitoring and reporting needs. Dynatrace also provides a range of best practices and resources to help you get the most out of your dashboards, including webinars, training courses, and a dedicated support team.
		-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	o Share Dashboard
		-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		To share a dashboard in Dynatrace, follow these steps:
