SRE 
		Site Reliability Engineering. 
		Set of principles and practices 
			apply software engineering approaches to 
				IT operations and infrastructure. 
		
	Key aspects of SRE:
		Focus on reliability and scalability: 
			SRE teams prioritize 
				systems up and running smoothly
					usage grows and changes. 
		Software-driven approach: 
			SRE uses 
				automation 
				software tools to manage 
					infrastructure, 
					monitor systems
					respond to incidents. 
			Reduce 
				manual effort 
				faster and efficient operations.

	Data-driven decision making: 
		Rely on data and metrics 
			analyze system performance
			identify potential issues
			track progress towards reliability goals.

	Proactive approach: 
		SRE not reacting to problems. 
		Proactively and efficiently 
			identifying and mitigating risks
			building robust systems
			continually improving processes.

	Collaboration and communication: 
		Define process and policies of making production reliability collaboratively.
		Doing it scientifically and data driven way.
		
	Here are some of the benefits of using SRE principles:

		Improve 
			uptime 
			performance 
				of software systems
		Reduce 
			operational costs 
				through automation and 
				proactive maintenance
		Faster 
			incident response and 
			resolution times
		Increased 
			business agility

	SRE principles
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Embrace Risk:

    Accept failures are inevitable in complex systems.
    Define acceptable levels of risk 
		Measure it through Service Level Objectives (SLOs).
    Allocate an "error budget" 
		to balance reliability with innovation.
    Avoid over-engineering for perfect uptime.

Setting Service Level Objectives (SLOs):

    Establish clear, measurable targets for system reliability and performance.
    Align SLOs with business objectives and user expectations.
    Use SLOs for 
		decision-making
		prioritize work
		measure success.
    Examples: "99.9% uptime," "latency under 100ms for 95% of requests."
	
	SLI (Service Level indicators)
		for a particular time.
		e.g.
			Request Latency
				time taken for 
						request to be processed and a response to be received. 
			Availability SLI (Service Level Indicator) 
				quantitative measure 
				percentage of 
					service is available as intended.

	SLO (Service Level Objectives)
		Binding target for a collection of SLIs
		e.g. Total amont of downtime in a year was less than 9 hours
		
		has upper and lower bounds
		higher SLO
			teams slow down
		lower SLO
			quality can be compromised
		watched between SRE and product
			on monthly/quaterly/annual
		
	SLA (Servie Level Agreement)
		Business agreement between 
			a customer and service provider
			based on SLOs
		watched between sales and customers
			violations result in payments
			
	
	SLA should be more lenient than SLO
		SLO failure should be a warning
			to act immediately.


Error Budgets:

    Allowed amount of downtime or errors 
		in a service over a given time period.
    SREs use error budgets to 
		strike a balance between 
			reliability and 
			development velocity. 
	If the error budget is exhausted, new features or changes are often deprioritized to focus on reliability.


	SLO : 99.9%
	
	Error budget: 
		.1 * 60 * 24 * 30
		43.2 min/month failures
	
	99.9% uptime = .1% downtime
	= .001 * 30 days / monthly * 24hour/day *60 min/ hour 
	Acceptable downtime in a month = 43.2 min/month
	
	Example use case
		e.g. needs db back up every 1 month and the app is down during this time.
			takes 15 min to backup
			
			time between failures = 30 days
				30 * 24* 60 
			downtime = 15 bad min. in a month.
			
			every two weeks application becomes slow.
			takes 30 min. for people to realize and support ticket to come.
				(consider this time also)
			30 min. to resolve
			affects 50 % of users
	
			(30 min. to detect + 30 min. to resolve) * 2 weeks/month (happens every 2 weeks) * 50 % users
			= 60 bad min./month

			
	
Eliminating Toil:

    Identify and automate repetitive, manual automatable tasks that drain time and energy.
    Free up engineers to focus on proactive improvements and innovation.
    Examples: automating deployments, scaling, configuration management, and incident response.

Monitoring:

    Implement comprehensive system monitoring to detect issues early.
    Collect and analyze data on system health, performance, and user behavior.
    Set alerts to notify engineers of potential problems.
    Use monitoring data to drive continuous improvement.

Automation:

    Use software and tools to automate tasks across operations and development.
    Reduce manual effort, improve efficiency, and minimize human error.
    Examples: automating deployments, testing, configuration management, and incident response.

Release Engineering:

    Establish a structured, repeatable process for software releases.
    Ensure smooth deployments, minimize risk, and improve quality.
    Involve SREs in release planning and testing.

Simplicity:

    Strive for simplicity in system design and operations.
    Reduce complexity to make systems easier to understand, manage, and troubleshoot.
    Prioritize clear abstractions and modularity.

Culture of Collaboration:

    Foster close collaboration between SREs and developers.
    Share responsibility for reliability and performance.
    Break down silos and encourage knowledge sharing.

Continuous Improvement:

    Embrace a culture of continuous learning and experimentation.
    Regularly review and refine processes, tools, and techniques.
    Use data to drive decision-making and measure progress.

Incident Management:

    Develop well-defined incident response processes, including clear roles and responsibilities.
    Prioritize rapid detection, response, and resolution of incidents.
    Conduct blameless post-mortems to learn from incidents and prevent recurrence.

Monitoring and Alerting:

    Establish comprehensive monitoring for key performance indicators and critical system metrics.
    Set up meaningful alerts based on SLIs to detect and respond to deviations from SLOs.
    Continuously refine alerting thresholds based on historical data and system behavior.

Capacity Planning:

    Regularly assess and forecast system capacity requirements.
    Use capacity planning to ensure that systems can handle expected loads and traffic spikes.
    Scale infrastructure proactively to accommodate growth.

Change Management:

    Implement practices such as canary releases, feature flags, and gradual rollouts to minimize the impact of changes.
    Establish a rigorous and standardized process for making and deploying changes to production.
    Monitor changes closely and roll back if unexpected issues arise.

Hybrid Roles and On-Call Responsibilities:

    Foster a culture of shared responsibility between development and operations teams.
    Implement an on-call rotation where team members are responsible for addressing incidents outside of regular working hours.
    Rotate on-call duties to distribute the burden and provide a broader understanding of system behavior.

Cultural Emphasis on Reliability:

    Cultivate a culture where reliability is a shared goal and responsibility across the organization.
    Encourage collaboration and communication between development, operations, and other relevant teams.

Risk Management:

    Assess and manage risks associated with system changes, updates, and operational processes.
    Use feature flags and gradual rollouts to minimize the impact of changes on system reliability.
    Continuously evaluate and mitigate potential risks to system performance.

Documentation and Knowledge Sharing:

    Maintain comprehensive and up-to-date documentation for systems, processes, and procedures.
    Encourage knowledge sharing through regular training, cross-functional collaboration, and documentation reviews.

Chaos Engineering:

    Conduct controlled experiments to proactively identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the system.
    Simulate real-world failure scenarios to test the resilience of systems and validate the effectiveness of recovery mechanisms.
